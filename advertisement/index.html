<!-- is it corny enough yet?-->
<h3 style="text-align: left">How do I sign up? </h3>
<p> Bruces army doesnt exist! But if you wont help old ladies across the street for the sake of it please do join this organization! If you wish to sign up, please find a Bruce you know and ask him to join! </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left"> Where are meetings held?</h3>
<p> Meetings are held nowhere, but if you wish to meet the other members of the army, you can summon them by chanting the phrase "black stapler!" three times at the top of your lungs in the most public place you can find. Members wont all show up at the same time so be sure to ask anyone walking around if they are a member.  </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left"> DISCLAIMER: </h3>
<p>Bruce's army is not affiliated with "Bruce Small" in any way shape or form, this organization has been created purely for service to others as well as strength in the community. However, if you would like to bother Bruce or myself with the information presented in this website, please do so at 1-800-222-2222, any phone calls you make will not be appreciated   </p>

    <p> This is a picture of me and my friend Joseph on our trip to Italy that 
        we took over the summer. Specifically, this was us hiking on the Amalfi coast
        and this was us making fun of the completly rotted out guard rail on cliff 
        edge trail.

    <h2> The family </h2>

    <p> My aunt Jo, my best friend, my dad, and my dads friend Kim in a picture 
        we took just before we went on our hike. We hiked along the Amalfi coast on the 
        west side of italy, and it was my dads idea to take a before and after photo of
        the hike.
    </p>
    <h2>The "after" picture</h2>
    <img src="fam2.jpg" alt="This is the picture we took after the hike" width = 600> 
    <p> We got rained out on our way down, but with no rain gear and 
        no shelter in sight we had no choice! we had to hike all 336 steps down the mountain 
        town on the other side.

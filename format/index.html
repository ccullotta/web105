    <h1> Community </h1>
    <h2> Plot Summary</h2>
    <p> Community was a <sup>six</sup>  season long TV show with an ensemble cast of characters 
        in a fictional community college. The story introduces <mark>Jeff Winger</mark>  
        as a morally challenged lawyer returning to school to earn his degrees again,
         after a judge found his old ones to be phony. Hilarity ensues and the show follows 
         a very outlandish out of the box type of comedy.</p>
         <h2> About the Writer </h3>
         <p> Community was written in part and produced by Dan Harmon, who has gone on now to 
             create the hit animated show <q><em>Rick and Morty</em></q>" after community as well as starting a couple
            slightly less succesful shows in between.  </p>
        <h2>my review</h3>
        <blockquote> It is without question the Community is the <del>best</del> <ins><strong>greatest</strong></ins>  TV show of all time, I consider it a great 
            travesty that the show was cancelled after only 6 seasons, <small>and I morn the loss of show every day. </small>

    <p style="color:red">  I want major in computer science specifically with machine learning, 
        and this realized after I took a C++ class here at MCC and an enthusiastic professor helped spark my interest </p>
    <h2 style="font:122; color: white; text-align: center"> web experiance/goal: </h2>
    <p style="color: blue; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: right;">  I have almost none; I have messed around with extremely basic HTML before 
        but nothing that could be considered an actual website. This is course that is in my destination field naturally, but I am taking it mostly out of curiosity. 
        I don't plan on dealing primarily with web development as a career, but I am interested in how it works and I hope to gain a useful rudimentary understanding. </p>
    <h3 style="font:136; color: white; text-align: center"> interesting thing about me and my photo</h3>

    <p style="color:green; font-family:sans-serif; text-align: center"> I have been homeschooled all my life through highschool, and have actually been taking classes 
        here at MCC for almost 5 years as a running start student. </p>
